# 05 Third-Party APIs: Work Day Scheduler

Created a scheduling application, where the user can save events for each hour of the day.
This application displays hours of 9am - 5pm. 

The app displays fields where the user can enter in events for each time block

The user can then click save to save the event to the page this is done through using local storage setItem and getItem.
By doing this the event persist even if the user reloads the page.

The time blocks also update in real time depending on if the event has pasted or is now or upcoming.
This is done through using jquery and moment.js to update each field.
